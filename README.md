# E-commerce

## Description

This repository is the back end of a fictional e-commerce website.
It uses the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect an Express.js API to a MySQL database.
The dotenv package is used to store sensitive data.
In the command line, npm run seed is run to seed the data to the database.
In the command line, server.js is run to start the server and sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database.
GET, POST, PUT and DELETE were tested in Insommia Core.
